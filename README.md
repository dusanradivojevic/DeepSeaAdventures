# Deep-Sea Adventures


## Description
It's survival of the biggest in this action packed deep-sea challenge. Eat your way to the top of the food chain as you swim through stunning underwater environments and encounter deadly predators. In Deep-Sea Adventures, players control a hungry marine predator intent on munching as many other fish as possible. The player chooses beetwen 3 aquatic species each trying to move up the food chain as the game progresses. As smaller fish are eaten, the player's own fish grows in size and becomes capable of eating somewhat larger fish. By the end of level 4, the fish is sufficiently large enough that it can eat almost anything on-screen. Players must be vigilant for danger signs as the ultimate shark predator might end their adventures.

## Implementation
